### Checklist:

#### Front

* [] Set up client folder and project structure.
* [] Use cra to bootstrap this application.
* [] Create a UI/UX with React using separate components for each "piece" of the interface.
* [] Ensure that state is separated out of the app with React's Context API in order to have components access state independently.

#### Back
* [X] Set up file/folder structure on back-end
* [] Set up api routes that allow data to be sent from our front-end to our database.
* [] Test api routes with Postman to ensure they work.
* [] Using mongoose, create models for our database that accept only data within constraints.
